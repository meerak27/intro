For my game I decided to recreate something that I typically enjoy playing. The genre of games I usually opt for is shooter games and that’s exactly what I created. The initial idea for this game was to make a car and have its tongue be the line with the tip being a reticle and it’s aim was to grab either tuna (+ points) or chocolate (- points) but when I got to coding that idea became harder to actually implement. The reason it became harder is because of my process. From the start I decided to scratch the aesthetics and idea and just focus on creating a functional game even if it had the most basic design. By doing so I created all my classes and everything was set and when it was time to add all the beautiful details and embellishments every time I added something it would just crash the game and ‘break’ the code. 

The inspiration behind my game were those trippy Instagram and TikTok loop gifs where you don’t know if it ended or it started. That’s why I chose a swirly GIF with a type of game that is so easy but gets more complex as it goes which makes you wanna keep trying. The incentive of having the high score there also makes you wanna keep trying to beat it (unless you’re not as competitive as me :p). 

Whenever I code a game next I will try to just start with the designs as I go along cause although I thought that my process was the most efficient it actually added hours of unnecessary extra work trying to beautify the game. Also, a regret I have is that I didn’t get a chance to properly use office hours because I think if I had met with the professor my code would have been much more efficient.

I mention efficiency a lot because for one of my classes (collisions.js) I originally had over 500 lines of code when it could have been 10 times less *literally*. It ended up being way less than 100 lines (36 LINES!!) and turns out the video I watched was just extremely inefficient and I didn’t ask for help so I did the same. I knew something was off when I realized I had spend 4 hour and had written 500 lines in one class for a game that is not so complex. I decided to comment them out function by function and see if the game would change and after commenting out over 400 lines I realized my mistake and that I wasted my time. It’s not all so bad because it taught me that asking for help when you’re confused is always better than doing the most and hoping for the best.

There was also another code I tried to add but it just did not work. I wanted to add starts similar to the look of the mario kart ones. The code is commented out since I hope to be able to figure it out after grades come out i didn’t delete it like I deleted the ones above for that reason. The main issue i had was the shape of the ‘star’ and also that by adding it the range between the star and balloon would also count as a collision which made the game far too easy.

So, it still leads back to the question of what my game turned out to be. After I coded the game I felt like I wanted to add a trippy GIF as a background to make it look more interesting and more aligned with my idea. My idea became to create a vortex like game which has warp sound effects to make it feel and look more alien-y. I love vortex like games and I chose to tint the background and resize the GIF to make it look more visually appealing to me. I had the bullets, shooter and reticle be random. Random - as you’ve gathered from all my previous assignments - is my favorite feature and thing I learned just because it allows my piece to look very artsy and cool. It also grabs the attention since it’s constantly changing which is what I wanted for the shooter and reticle so it can stand out on the moving trippy background.

The balloon class has the targets and I have it saved under balloons since it’s supposed to be floating in and I didn’t want to just call it floating objects do I called it by what it was. The balloon is white and has a thick stroke so it can be visible but not too visible to the point where it’s very easy that’s why it has no fill. I also made the targets relatively small because there are two ways to play the game. I always love games that can be played both ways. I also took into account how some people may be using touchpad and how some may use mouse and keyboard. If they are on m&k they can use both features where they move the arrow buttons while shooting and get really highscores. If not they can just use or the other and still get relatively high scores depending on how quick they are.

The game although it isn’t too complex is the exact kind of game I wanted. It’s one that wraps you in and makes you lose track of time. It kind of enchants you seeing as how the trippy background revolves around the circle. The issue I faced that is still present is that the GIF sometimes freezes for a couple frames then continues. Anything I tried to ameliorate this problem always ended up making it worse. I am still working on it and after this assignment is graded I will hopefully improve upon the game. 

I really loved making this game because it is something I never thought I would be able to do. I am incredibly proud of myself for creating a creative functional game. When the professor (you :D) mentioned a game I had a mini heart-attack because it was so challenging to me but due to the fast-paced nature of the class I learned so much so fast and it is something I really love. I was contemplating IM as my second major and creating the game and seeing it play and how proud my friends & family were really confirmed it in head and now I am 100% sure I would like it to be my second major. Seeing the friendly nature of the IM community (based off of our class, professor and other instructors) it is such a welcoming helpful community that I hope to continue being a part of!!

I enjoyed the process of coding a game and I was happy that even I lost track of time playing my own game!! It was kind of a full circle moment for me because at the start I had difficulty coding a square but now I made a full blown functional game! 

Improvements I want to add are to adjust the GIF and add a separate instruction slide. I added a picture with instructions and had it ready but it would not function properly as the game would still start and may cause you to die while reading the instructions.

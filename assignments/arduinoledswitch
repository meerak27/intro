Arduino LED Switch - Week 8
---

Today was our first day using Arduino and was my very first day doing anything like this. Of course, I was overwhelmed when I saw the many things in the kit, but I couldn't be any more excited after creating my first assignment.

I was a little confused during my class since my Arduino had the wrong cable, so I had to wait till I got batteries as a temporary solution. I followed along in class without electricity, but I unplugged everything after class. I did that, so whenever I sat down and did the assignment, I would have to see if any of it stuck with me, and I am glad that it did. I found it _extremely_ helpful when you explained the logic behind the wire placements, so I did the same in my video to create a thorough video, and so it is something I can look back at if I ever forget the basics. 

For the assignments, I did it so that if I clap my hands, the LED switches on. Gold is an excellent conductor of electricity, so I used my Rings to make it possible. You suggested that we do an everyday action; it's standard practice for me to wear my rings, so I wanted to incorporate them. 

However, this was not my first idea. I have attached a link below of me messing around with another idea, but I scratched it cause it looked awkward and ugly.

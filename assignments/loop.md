Loop-Week 2
---
For this assignment I wanted to make a moving set of random soap bubbles. I was playing with my baby cousins and got inspired with how the bubbles floated from side to side and loved the different colors based on the reflecton. At first, I had complictaions actaully making the for loop but then I  got the hang of it. I have attached a link and the full screen of my code. Hope you enjoy :)

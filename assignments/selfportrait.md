## Self Portrait
___


The portrait I coded has similar features to myself minus the angry expression :p. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this piece and found it extremely rewarding seeing the final product. For the colors I even used a color picker to take colors from my own pictures so I can get accurate colors. This is my first ever experience with any sort of coding so it was challenging trying to do different shapes and make them go exactly where i wanted. However, I tried to challenge myself and use a variety of different shapes and sizes and you can clearly see the trial and error in my code. I found that commenting on my code as I go was extremely benefical and so was setting variables for the values I knew needed adjustting. I hope you enjoy this piece as much as I enjoyed making it. :)

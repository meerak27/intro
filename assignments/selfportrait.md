## Self Portrait
___


I chose to do a picture that resembled me as a baby. For some reason I would always pose straight faced in abby pictures and have a no emotions resting face. 
I thoroughly enjoyed creating this piece and found it extremely rewarding seeing ht efinal product. This is my first ever experience with any sort of coding
so it was challenging trying to do different shapes and make them go exactly where i wanted. However, I tried to challenge myself and use a variety of 
different shapes and sizes and you can clearly see the trial and error in my code. I found that commenting on my code as I go was extremely benefical and so
was setting variables for the values I knew needed adjustting. I hope you enjoy this piece as much as I enjoyed matching it. :)
_ps. be nice it is my first piece ever_

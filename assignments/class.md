I enjoyed making this piece since the actual final piece is really fun to play around with. The increasing triangles and circles that move with your cursor make the piece really fun. It was honestly confusing coding this piece since I missed the class but after watching a couple videos and reading articles I understood. I wanted to challenge myself and use 2 classes and I did so with a triangle and circle.

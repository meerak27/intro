I have narrowed down my idea and have started creating the shapes necessary before putting it all together. Essentially I am goinng to create a shooter game but with a fun twist. A cat trying to protect itself from incoming balls (or an object) and aiming to get tuna as a power up and avoid chocolate. I got the isnpiration from my own hobbies and interests. I am planning on incorportating an elemnt of eveyrhting learned in class and make it something fun to play. I was coding the cat and tried to make it resemble mine.  

The way I am going about this is drawing the idea on my ipad and all the steps. Then using the knowledge from class and the reference to actually code the pieces of information. My laptop has been laggy so this is the only issue I am currently facing so I am using an at home monitor. Hopefully, this will be resolved before nect class or next week at most since I cant bring my work and work whenever which is an inconvenience. I am planning on doing the power ups but if i for some reason cant figure out both power up and power down I might resort to something simpler but I am hopeful that I will be able to and will try my best. 

I need to figure out how to do more complex shapes and concepts to give the game the feel I want. I was having difficulty but videos by The Coding Train helped me understand.

The idea of the game is nto too complex but it is just something to play in ur free time. The cat is hungry and needs to protect itself from the incoming balls that may harm it. The tuna is benefiical and the chocolate is harmful as with most cats in real life. Its a fun concept and im really excited to get it done. I am very swamped with my midterms so I am a little stressed but I think that with time managment and mainly after Thursday I will be able to get it done the way I want to!

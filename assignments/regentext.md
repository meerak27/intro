## Regenerative Text
___
For this assignment I wanted to combine a couple of the concepts we have learned this week. I really loved the spiral and I put it as if it was buffering the text below it. The text are my initials MK. Its the name under all my social media and funny enough it is what most people on campus know me as since before we joined it was my whatsapp name. 
I really wanted to make the MK bounce upon the mousepressed but I just could not figure it out. Something I loved about creating this piece was the randomness of it. The chances of getting the same piece with each time you repeat the loop is slim to none. I found that its something I love using in almsot all of the code I do in class. I also wanted to add the noise since the text regen was me so I wanted to make it similar to me.  I take time to become comfortable being msyelf but when I do im random and all over the place.
